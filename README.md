## Description

_Duration: 2 day sprint_

A gallery of a few important things in my life.

To see the fully functional site, please visit: [DEPLOYED VERSION OF APP](www.heroku.com)

## Installation

Here are the steps to get this app running on your own machine:

1. Create a database named `react_gallery`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
